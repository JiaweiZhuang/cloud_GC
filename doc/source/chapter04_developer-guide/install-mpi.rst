Install MPI libraries
=====================

GCHP would need MPI library. Most of other models would need MPI, too.

Enabling in-node MPI parallelization is pretty trivial since no network configurations are required. For cross-node MPI run, using the pre-built MPI library provided by :ref:`HPC cluster management tools <hpc-overview-label>` would be much easier.

More details coming soon...
