Scripts to build GCHP on the cloud (works but highly experimental!)

Tested with GCHP v11-02e:
- commit a1d3b46 in https://bitbucket.org/gcst/gc_bleeding_edge.git
- commit bfcc105 in https://bitbucket.org/gcst/GCHP.git
- commit eca29e0 in https://bitbucket.org/gcst/ut_bleeding_edge
Currently needs many dirty fixes for MAPL. Might be improved in future versions.

Steps:
1. Run ./build_GCHP_env.sh to install libraries
2. Source ./bashrc_GCHP_CentOS to set environment and apply additional fixes
3. (!!??) Install anaconda and numpy, because MAPL needs f2py to compile.
4. Then follow http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/Getting_Started_With_GCHP#GCHP_Quick_Start_Guide to configure and compile GCHP.

Also need to change GCHP/Shared/Config/ESMA_base.mk to fix MAPL_COMMS___.f90 error.

Minor note:
Top-level Makefile uses "git -C" that is not implemented in git1.8.3 on CentOS7.
